## <a name="how-it-works"></a>How It Works
A user can register and log back into their account, where their last inputted emergency contact and activity will be shown and saved. If anything in this form needs to be updated, they can update and then submit a time that they want to be texted to be checked on. 

Using Twilio and the schedule library, the app sends a text message to the user at the specified time. If they do not respond within 5 minutes, a text will be scheduled to be sent to their emergency contact with the userâ€™s last activity. Using the Google Maps API, their location will also be sent to the emergency contact if the user allows the browser to request their location.
